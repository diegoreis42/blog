#### About the name

The name of this blog comes from the excellent paper [_'No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering'_](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/Reading/NoSilverBullet.pdf) by Fred Brooks that defines the principle of many concepts that I value, especially that if we want better software we need better developers and people, no tool will do magic.

> "Hence, although I strongly support the technology-transfer and curriculumdevelopment efforts now under way, I think the most important single effort we can mount is to develop ways to grow great designers." - Fred Brooks

#### About me

My name is Diego Reis, I'm a Computer Science student at Itajubá Federal University and I currently work as a Junior back-end developer at a consulting firm. I'm very interested in ~almost~ any topic involving computing, I love helping other people, running in the late afternoon and trying new things.
