Some days ago I was reading the awesome blog [All Things Distributed](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com) from the goat Werner Vogels, and the series _Back-to-Basics_ in particular caught my attention, it is basically some classical CS papers that Vogels considers important to know. In addition, other great 
blog, [blag](https://avi.im/blag/), also has some posts about good papers, so why can't we have one too?

First-to-basics aims to be a series of posts about CS concepts using classical papers that I tripped during my quest for knowledge. As I am very early, I gonna try to give as much context as possible and walk through the topics the better I can.

Without further ado...

## CAP Theorem

I chose CAP Theorem because it is controversial, some folks
