I like good books. When I was a teenager most of my time was spent reading, everything started with
the great Julie Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas_, this took me really into sci-fi, things
like: _Neuromancer_, _Fundation_, _Dune_ and more recently _Three Body Problem_. Lately, due my obssesion by computer stuffs, 95% of my readings are random and useful chapters of technical books and blog posts.

Without further ado, my current and ever-changing, list of awesome books!

### Computing 

- [SICP](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf)

This book has my favorite intro of all time (who doesn't want to feel like a wizard right?). Unfortunately, I doesn't take the exercises serious enough so for sure that is a reading that I will redo at some point (next month hopefully).

- [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://github.com/phoenixsense/CS500/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation_third%20edition%20-%20Michael%20Sipser.pdf)

I know i know, it's too dry, too mathematical, but, for me was minding blowing. I mean, do we ever stop to wondering: why computers even work? Properties of computation can being replicated? What are the implications of having a Turing Machine? What Turing Machine means? Really, read this is hard, but if you
like to philosophize like me, that's a banger.

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](https://learnyouahaskell.com/)

This book feels like a fresh air on the beach, the reading is fun, the author takes a really effort to make people grasp some Haskell and it works! Haskell is great, I have never tried to make real things with it though, but getting some concepts of FP and not freaking out by reading the M word worth the reading.
