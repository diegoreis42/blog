<meta name="description" content="About the name
The name of this blog comes from the excellent paper &lsquo;No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering&rsquo; by Fred Brooks that defines the principle of many concepts that I value, especially that if we want better software we need better developers and people, no tool will do magic.

&ldquo;Hence, although I strongly support the technology-transfer and curriculumdevelopment efforts now under way, I think the most important single effort we can mount is to develop ways to grow great designers.&rdquo; - Fred Brooks" />
