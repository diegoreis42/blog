The name of this blog comes from the excellent paper &lsquo;No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering&rsquo; by Fred Brooks that defines the principle of many concepts that I value, especially that if we want better software we need better developers and people, no tool will do magic.

&ldquo;Hence, although I strongly support the technology-transfer and curriculumdevelopment efforts now under way, I think the most important single effort we can mount is to develop ways to grow great designers.&rdquo; - Fred Brooks" />

<h4 id="about-me">About me</h4>
<p>My name is Diego Reis, I&rsquo;m a Computer Science student at Itajubá Federal University and I currently work as a Junior back-end developer at a consulting firm. I&rsquo;m very interested in <del>almost</del> any topic involving computing, I love helping other people, running in the late afternoon and trying new things.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m very early in my career, more technical posts may be incomplete and/or contain small errors, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to suggest corrections and improvements.</p>
